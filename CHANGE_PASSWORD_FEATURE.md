# Change Patient Password Feature (Super Admin Only)

## Overview
A new feature has been added that allows **Super Admins only** to manually change patient passwords directly from the Patients Page.

## Features Added

### 1. Backend API Endpoint
**Location:** `routes/patientRoutes.js`

**Endpoint:** `PUT /api/patients/:id/change-password`

**Functionality:**
- Validates password length (minimum 6 characters)
- Finds the patient by ID
- Hashes the new password using bcrypt
- Updates the patient's password in the database
- Returns success/error response

**Security:**
- Password is hashed before storage using bcrypt with salt rounds
- Validates patient existence before updating
- Proper error handling

### 2. Frontend Implementation
**Location:** `client/src/components/Dashboard/PatientsPage.js`

**UI Components Added:**
1. **Change Password Button** (Purple gradient)
   - Only visible to Super Admins
   - Located in the Patient Details modal
   - Modern, clean design matching the existing UI

2. **Change Password Modal**
   - Professional purple-themed modal
   - Shows patient information (name and email)
   - Two password fields (New Password and Confirm Password)
   - Real-time validation
   - Warning message about super admin action
   - Success/error feedback

**Features:**
- Password must be at least 6 characters
- Password confirmation validation
- Clear error messages
- Patient context displayed
- Super admin warning badge
- Smooth animations and hover effects

### 3. Access Control
**Authorization:** Super Admin Only (`isSuperAdmin` check)

The feature uses the `useAuth` hook to check if the logged-in user is a super admin:
```javascript
const { isSuperAdmin } = useAuth();
```

Only super admins will see:
- The "Change Password" button in patient details
- The password change modal

### 4. Design Aesthetics
**Color Scheme:**
- Primary: Purple gradient (`#8b5cf6` to `#7c3aed`)
- Accent: Light purple backgrounds
- Warning: Amber/yellow for super admin notices
- Error: Red gradient for error messages

**Modern Features:**
- Rounded corners (10-12px border radius)
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Box shadows for depth
- Professional typography (Inter Tight font)
- Responsive layout
- Clear visual hierarchy

### 5. User Experience Flow

1. **Super Admin** logs in
2. Navigate to Patients Page
3. Click on a patient to view details
4. Click "Change Password" button (purple)
5. Modal opens showing:
   - Patient name and email
   - New password field
   - Confirm password field
   - Warning about super admin action
6. Enter new password (min 6 characters)
7. Confirm password
8. Click "Change Password"
9. Success message displayed
10. Patient can now login with new password

### 6. Error Handling
- Empty password validation
- Minimum length validation (6 characters)
- Password mismatch validation
- Server error handling
- Clear error messages displayed to user

## Security Considerations

1. **Authorization:** Only super admins can access this feature
2. **Password Hashing:** All passwords are hashed using bcrypt
3. **Validation:** Server-side validation ensures password requirements
4. **Audit Trail:** Action is logged in console (can be extended to database)
5. **User Notification:** Consider adding email notification to patient (future enhancement)

## Testing Checklist

## Future Enhancements

2. **Audit Log:** Log all password changes with admin ID and timestamp
3. **Password Requirements:** Add more complex password requirements
4. **Password History:** Prevent reuse of recent passwords
5. **Two-Factor Reset:** Require super admin 2FA for password changes
6. **Temporary Password:** Option to generate temporary password that must be changed on first login

## Files Modified
